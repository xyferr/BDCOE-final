## Key Features
- **🫎Species Identification:** Utilizes deep learning to classify and identify wildlife species present in images and videos.
- **🔭Object Detection:** Locates and outlines animals in frames, providing valuable insights into their spatial distribution.
- **📈Population Monitoring:** Enables tracking of individual animals and estimation of population trends over time.
- **⚠️Alert System:** Notifies wildlife authorities or researchers when unexpected species presence is detected, potentially indicating illegal activities.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow:** Primary deep learning framework for model development.
- **Keras:** High-level API integrated with TensorFlow for neural network modeling.
- **Python:** Programming language used for project implementation.
- **OpenCV:** Library for computer vision tasks such as image preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive development environment for experimentation and analysis.
