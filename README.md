# <u>Wildlife Conservation with Computer Vision</u>
_This project aims to contribute to wildlife conservation efforts by utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to identify and track endangered species in the wild through the analysis of images and videos captured by wildlife cameras or drones._

## Key Features
- **🫎Species Identification:** Utilizes deep learning to classify and identify wildlife species present in images and videos.
- **🔭Object Detection:** Locates and outlines animals in frames, providing valuable insights into their spatial distribution.
- **📈Population Monitoring:** Enables tracking of individual animals and estimation of population trends over time.
- **⚠️Alert System:** Notifies wildlife authorities or researchers when unexpected species presence is detected, potentially indicating illegal activities.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow:** Primary deep learning framework for model development.
- **Keras:** High-level API integrated with TensorFlow for neural network modeling.
- **Python:** Programming language used for project implementation.
- **OpenCV:** Library for computer vision tasks such as image preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive development environment for experimentation and analysis.
